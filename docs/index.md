  - In How People Use ChatGPT (NBER Working Paper 34255, September 2025), Aaron Chatterji, Thomas Cunningham, David Deming, Zoe Hitzig, Christopher Ong, Carl Yan Shan, and Kevin Wadman explore how the rapid adoption of large language model chatbots—specifically ChatGPT—has translated into actual usage. Drawing on data from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, the authors analyze how adoption has spread globally and what kinds of tasks users most commonly employ ChatGPT for. Their findings reveal that while work-related uses are growing, non-work usage now accounts for a large majority of conversations, with “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” dominating the types of interaction.https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w34255/w34255.pdf
